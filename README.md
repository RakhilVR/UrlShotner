Overview
The URL Shortener project is designed to efficiently convert long URLs into short and manageable links. This project utilizes the Node.js framework with Express.js for the server-side development, while MongoDB Atlas serves as the database. On the client side, React.js is employed to create a user-friendly interface for generating and managing shortened URLs.
